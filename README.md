The application is designed to create menu .doc files with the ability to translate the menu. 
After logging in, a screen appears with the creation of a menu and further adding dishes to the menu. 
Adding dishes includes adding a photo of the dish with the ability to graphically improve it. 
Then writing the name of the dish. Having a picture and a name of the dish, you can use Gemini to write a description of the dish. 
But you can write the description yourself. After filling in the entire menu, save the menu as a .doc file and translate it into any language of the world using Gemini. 
You can also edit and delete dishes.
All data and images are saved in Firebase.
